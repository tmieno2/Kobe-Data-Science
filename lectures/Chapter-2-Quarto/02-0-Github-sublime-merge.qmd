## Github

+ Github is an online service to store primarily computer programs (small datasets are okay to store).
+ Github **repository** is like a folder on your computer (but it is online)
  + public: anybody can access it
  + private: only the owner can access it (you cannot even see it on Github)
+ There are numerous public repositories that serve as excellent examples to learn coding
+ You can **clone** (just another way of saying **copy**) any public Github repositories to your local computer

:::{.callout-note title=Objective}
Learn how to clone Github repositories.
:::

## Sublime Merge

+ In cloning Github repositories, we will use Sublime Merge. 

+ Sublime Merge is certainly not the only option. But, I found it very easy and light-weight to use especially for just cloning Github repositories.

:::{.callout-note title="Install Sublime Merge"}
Click [here](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) and install it.

## Clone a repository to your computer

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Copy the url of the repository

1. Visit the Github repository you want to clone (copy)
2. Click on the Code button
3. Click on the a button with two sheets of papers, which will copy the url of the repository

### Clone the repository

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Step 1

Go to Sublime Merge and follow `file -> Clone Repository`

![](merge-initiate-clone.png){width=80%}


#### Step 2

You should now see something like below.

![](merge-clone.png){width=60%}

+ Note that the source url you copied is already printed on the `Source URL` box (if not, just paste the url yourself).
+ On `Repository Name`, the name of the repository for which you copied the url is printed automatically. If you would like a different name, type the name you want.
+ On `Destination Path`, click on the gray box with `...` to select the folder on your machine in which the repository is going to be cloned.
+ Finally, hit the `Clone` button

### Do it yourself

+ Let's clone a repository that has many templates and sample qmd files used in this course. 

+ We will actually use this template later, so do not delete it after you clone it.

+ The repository is found [here](https://github.com/tmieno2/quarto-revealjs-example).
