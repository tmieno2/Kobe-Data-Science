# Course Description: 

The goal of this course is to prepare students for jobs that require quantitative skills beyond Microsoft Excel and graduate programs. The R software is used throughout the course. In order to achieve the goal, students will be introduced to the basics of programming and how to apply it to real world issues in the field of agricultural (agricultural economics, agronomy, etc) and environmental sciences. By completing the course, students will know data wrangling (e.g., merging, transforming datasets), data visualization, and exploratory data analysis, spatial data management.

# Reading Materials

+ Recommended: 

  - Grolemund, Garrett. and Wickham, Hadley. 2019 \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{"R for Data Science"} 
  - Lovelace, Robin., Nowosad, Jakub., and Muenchow, Jannes. 2019 \href{https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/}{"Geocomputation with R"}

+ Prerequisites:

  - Introductory statistics (STAT 218) or equivalent

# Grading

```{r}
#| echo: false
grade_table <- 
  data.table(
    title = c("Assignments (2 assignments)", "Final Paper", "Total"),
    score = c("60%", "40%", "100%")
  )

flextable(grade_table) %>% autofit()
```

+ **Assignments**: There will be 2 assignments. Late submissions will have 1/3 of a letter grade deducted from the grade for that submission, increasing by an additional 1/3 grade for each 24 hours beyond the deadline.

+ **Final Paper**: In this assignment, you write a short paper with a particular emphasis on programming using real-world data sets. You must identify a topic that would involve collecting datasets from multiple different data sources. The topic has to be approved by me to avoid a final project without significant programming tasks by \textcolor{red}{Oct, 30}. The proposal of your final project detailing what datasets to use, where you collect them, and how you use them have to be submitted by \textcolor{red}{Nov, 7}.

# Important Deadlines: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
get_closest_date <- function(date, day) {
  return_date <-
    data.table(
      w_date = seq(start_date, end_date, by = "days")
    ) %>%
    .[, w_day := weekdays(w_date)] %>%
    .[w_date >= date, ] %>%
    .[w_day == day, ] %>%
    .[1, w_date]

  return(return_date)
}


start_date <- mdy("08-26-2024")
end_date <- mdy("12-20-2024") # Friday of the final week
topic_approval_date <- 
  get_closest_date(
    date = start_date + months(2),
    day = "Wednesday"
  )
topic_proposa_data <- 
  get_closest_date(
    date = topic_approval_date + weeks(2),
    day = "Wednesday"
  )

final_project_date <- end_date
```

+ Final project topic approved by the instructor: `r format(topic_approval_date, "%B %d")`
+ Final project proposal: `r format(topic_proposa_data, "%B %d")`
+ Final project submission: `r format(final_project_date, "%B %d")`
